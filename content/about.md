DynastyProcess.com is a collaboration by Tan Ho and Joe Sydlowski. 

Our mission is to deliver high-quality resources and data for DynastyFF analysis and development.

We're dedicated to collaborative and open-source work. If you've got ideas, feedback, bugs, or any other extensions on the work found here, please reach out [directly on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dynastyprocess) and we'd love to have a conversation about it!

If you'd like to support us and our research, please feel free to [buy us a coffee on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tanho) (where you can also support us with a recurring contribution!)
